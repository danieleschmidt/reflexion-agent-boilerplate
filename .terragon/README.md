- **`value-discovery.py`** - Autonomous value discovery and prioritization engine  
- **`debt-tracker.py`** - Technical debt analysis and tracking system
- **`autonomous-executor.py`** - Main execution engine for implementing improvements
- **`requirements.txt`** - Python dependencies for the system

### Documentation
- **`MODERNIZATION_STRATEGY.md`** - Comprehensive modernization roadmap
- **`README.md`** - This file, system overview and usage

### Generated Reports (Created during execution)
- **`BACKLOG.md`** - Prioritized value item backlog
- **`DEBT_REPORT.md`** - Technical debt analysis report
- **`EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`** - High-level summary of autonomous activities
- **`value-metrics.json`** - Detailed metrics and analytics data
- **`debt-data.json`** - Technical debt data export

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r .terragon/requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run value discovery
python3 .terragon/value-discovery.py

# Analyze technical debt  
python3 .terragon/debt-tracker.py

# Run full autonomous enhancement cycle
python3 .terragon/autonomous-executor.py
```

## üîß Configuration

The system is configured via `.terragon/config.yaml`. Key settings include:

```yaml
scoring:
  weights:
    wsjf: 0.5              # Weighted Shortest Job First weight
    ice: 0.2               # Impact, Confidence, Ease weight  
    technical_debt: 0.2    # Technical debt weight
    security: 0.1          # Security priority weight

discovery:
  sources:
    - git_history          # Analyze commit history and TODO comments
    - static_analysis      # Code quality and complexity analysis
    - dependency_scan      # Security and update scanning
    - performance_metrics  # Performance regression detection
```

## üìä Value Discovery Process

### 1. Multi-Source Discovery
- **Git History**: TODO/FIXME comments, commit patterns
- **Static Analysis**: Code quality issues, complexity hotspots
- **Dependencies**: Outdated packages, security vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: Optimization opportunities
- **Documentation**: Missing or outdated documentation

### 2. Advanced Scoring
The system uses a hybrid scoring model combining:
- **WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First)**: Cost of delay vs effort
- **ICE (Impact, Confidence, Ease)**: Business value assessment
- **Technical Debt Impact**: Long-term maintenance cost
- **Security Priority**: Vulnerability severity and exposure

### 3. Intelligent Prioritization
Items are ranked by composite score considering:
- Business impact and user value
- Implementation effort and complexity
- Risk level and rollback capability
- Hot-spot analysis (frequently changed files)

## üîç Technical Debt Tracking

### Debt Categories
- **Code Complexity**: High cyclomatic complexity, large classes
- **Security Issues**: Vulnerabilities, unsafe patterns
- **Performance**: Inefficient algorithms, memory issues
- **Maintainability**: TODO comments, code smells
- **Documentation**: Missing docstrings, outdated docs
- **Dependencies**: Outdated packages, license issues

### Debt Scoring
Each debt item receives a composite score based on:
- Severity level (critical, high, medium, low)
- Estimated remediation effort
- Interest rate (how fast debt grows)
- Hot-spot multiplier (file change frequency)

## ‚ö° Autonomous Execution

The autonomous executor can handle various improvement types:

### Automatically Executable
- ‚úÖ Code quality fixes (ruff auto-fix)
- ‚úÖ Documentation improvements
- ‚úÖ Safe dependency updates (patch versions)
- ‚úÖ TODO comment documentation
- ‚úÖ Technical debt planning

### Requires Manual Review
- üîç Security vulnerability fixes
- üîç Complex refactoring (high complexity functions)
- üîç Architecture changes (large classes)
- üîç Performance optimizations

## üìà Continuous Enhancement Cycle

1. **Discovery Phase**: Scan repository for improvement opportunities
2. **Analysis Phase**: Assess technical debt and value potential
3. **Prioritization Phase**: Score and rank all discovered items
4. **Execution Phase**: Automatically implement highest-value items
5. **Validation Phase**: Run tests and quality checks
6. **Integration Phase**: Create pull requests for review
7. **Learning Phase**: Update models based on outcomes

## üéØ Success Metrics

### Repository Maturity Progression
- **Baseline**: 70-75% (Maturing)
- **Target**: 85%+ (Advanced)
- **Tracking**: Continuous measurement and improvement

### Key Performance Indicators
- Total technical debt reduction
- Security vulnerability elimination  
- Test coverage improvement
- Documentation completeness
- Developer productivity metrics

## üîÑ Continuous Operation

### Scheduled Execution
- **Immediate**: After each PR merge
- **Hourly**: Security and dependency scanning
- **Daily**: Comprehensive analysis and debt assessment
- **Weekly**: Deep architecture review and optimization
- **Monthly**: Strategic alignment and model recalibration
