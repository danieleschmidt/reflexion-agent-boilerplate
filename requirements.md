# Requirements Document
## Reflexion Agent Boilerplate

### Problem Statement
Implement a production-ready framework for adding self-reflection capabilities to language agents across multiple AI frameworks (AutoGen, CrewAI, LangChain, Claude-Flow).

### Success Criteria
1. Framework-agnostic reflexion implementation
2. Episodic memory system for learning from past experiences
3. Self-critique templates for various domains
4. Metrics export integration with observability platforms
5. Failure recovery and human-in-the-loop capabilities
6. 80%+ test coverage and comprehensive documentation

### Scope
- Core reflexion engine
- Framework adapters (AutoGen, CrewAI, LangChain, Claude-Flow)
- Memory systems (episodic, structured)
- Evaluation and metrics
- Visualization components
- Benchmarking suite

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: Sub-second reflection processing
- Scalability: Support for 1000+ concurrent agents
- Reliability: 99.9% uptime for memory systems
- Security: No exposure of sensitive model outputs
- Compliance: Apache 2.0 license compatibility
