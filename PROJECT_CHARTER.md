# Project Charter: Reflexion Agent Boilerplate

## Project Overview

### Problem Statement
Current AI agent frameworks lack built-in learning and self-improvement capabilities. Agents make the same mistakes repeatedly, fail to learn from experience, and require constant human intervention to improve their performance. This limitation significantly reduces their effectiveness in production environments and prevents the development of truly autonomous AI systems.

### Solution Vision
Reflexion Agent Boilerplate provides a production-ready implementation of reflexion (self-reflection + self-improvement) that can be integrated into any existing agent framework with minimal code changes. The system enables agents to learn from failures, build episodic memory, and continuously improve their performance over time.

1. **Core Reflexion Engine**
   - Self-reflection and critique capabilities
   - Iterative improvement mechanisms
   - Failure analysis and learning
   - Success pattern recognition

2. **Framework Integration**
   - AutoGen adapter (Microsoft)
   - CrewAI adapter (Multi-agent orchestration)
   - LangChain adapter (LangChain ecosystem)
   - Claude-Flow adapter (Anthropic workflows)

3. **Memory Systems**
   - Episodic memory storage and retrieval
   - Pattern extraction and analysis
   - Long-term learning persistence
   - Memory consolidation algorithms

4. **Evaluation Framework**
   - Success criteria definition

### Out of Scope
1. **LLM Development**: We integrate with existing LLM providers, not develop new models
2. **Agent Framework Creation**: We enhance existing frameworks, not create new ones
3. **Domain-Specific Applications**: We provide the platform, not specific use-case implementations
4. **Hardware Optimization**: Focus is on software architecture, not hardware acceleration
