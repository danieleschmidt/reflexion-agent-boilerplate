## üß† Advanced AI Capabilities

### Intelligent Code Generation
```python
# Example: Generated factorial function with validation and tests
def factorial(n):
    """Calculate factorial of a number with input validation."""
    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a non-negative integer")
    
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

# Test cases
assert factorial(0) == 1
assert factorial(5) == 120
```

### Multi-Modal Reflection
