## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our software seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Reflexion Agent Boilerplate, please report it to us responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to security@your-org.com with the following information:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Suggested fix (if available)

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.

2. **Initial Assessment**: We will perform an initial assessment within 5 business days and provide an estimated timeline for a fix.

3. **Fix Development**: We will work on developing and testing a fix.

4. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline, typically:
   - Immediate fix for critical vulnerabilities
   - 30 days for high severity vulnerabilities
   - 90 days for medium/low severity vulnerabilities

5. **Recognition**: We will acknowledge your contribution in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest supported version
2. **Secure Configuration**: Follow our security configuration guidelines
3. **Environment Variables**: Never commit API keys or secrets to version control
4. **Network Security**: Use HTTPS/TLS for all communications
5. **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization

### For Developers

1. **Code Review**: All code changes must be reviewed by at least one other developer
2. **Static Analysis**: Use security linting tools (bandit, semgrep)
3. **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies and monitor for vulnerabilities
4. **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all inputs
5. **Secret Management**: Use secure secret management solutions

## Security Features

### Built-in Security

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints include rate limiting protection
- **Authentication**: Support for multiple authentication methods
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Audit Logging**: Security-relevant events are logged

### Security Scanning

Our CI/CD pipeline includes:

- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing with CodeQL and Semgrep
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning of dependencies
- **Container Scanning**: Security scanning of Docker images
- **Secret Scanning**: Detection of accidentally committed secrets
- **License Compliance**: Automated license compliance checking

## Compliance

### Standards

This project follows security best practices including:

- OWASP Top 10 guidelines
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- ISO 27001 principles
- SOC 2 Type II controls (where applicable)

### Certifications

- Security scanning with industry-standard tools
- Regular penetration testing (for enterprise deployments)
- Compliance documentation available on request

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Security-related environment variables
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here          # Used for encryption
API_RATE_LIMIT=100                       # Requests per minute
ENABLE_AUTH=true                         # Enable authentication
SSL_VERIFY=true                          # Verify SSL certificates
LOG_LEVEL=INFO                           # Avoid DEBUG in production
```

### Secure Deployment

1. **Use HTTPS**: Always deploy with TLS/SSL encryption
2. **Network Isolation**: Deploy in isolated network segments
3. **Firewall Rules**: Implement restrictive firewall rules
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep system and dependencies updated
5. **Monitoring**: Implement security monitoring and alerting

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Document**: Record all incident details
3. **Notify**: Contact security@your-org.com immediately
4. **Coordinate**: Work with our security team on response
5. **Follow-up**: Participate in post-incident review
