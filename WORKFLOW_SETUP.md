# GitHub Actions Workflows Setup

Due to GitHub permissions limitations, the CI/CD workflows need to be added manually. Here are the 5 comprehensive workflow files that complete the SDLC automation:

## Files to Add to `.github/workflows/`

### 1. `ci.yml` - Continuous Integration
**Purpose**: Complete CI pipeline with quality gates, testing, and security scanning

**Features**:
- Matrix testing across Python 3.9-3.11 and multiple OS (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)
- Code quality checks (Black, isort, flake8, pylint, mypy)
- Security scanning (bandit, safety, CodeQL, Trivy)
- Unit and integration testing with coverage reporting
- Docker image building and testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Artifact publishing

### 2. `cd.yml` - Continuous Deployment
**Purpose**: Automated deployment pipeline for staging and production

**Features**:
- Docker image building and publishing to GitHub Container Registry
- PyPI package publishing with trusted publishing
- Staging deployment automation
- Production deployment with approvals
- Documentation deployment to GitHub Pages
- Smoke tests and health checks
- Slack notifications

### 3. `security.yml` - Security Scanning
**Purpose**: Comprehensive security scanning and compliance

**Features**:
- Weekly scheduled security scans
- Dependency vulnerability scanning (Safety, OSV Scanner)
- SAST with Semgrep and CodeQL
- Secret scanning with TruffleHog
- Container security scanning with Trivy
- SBOM generation
- License compliance checking
- Security policy validation

### 4. `maintenance.yml` - Automated Maintenance
**Purpose**: Repository maintenance and health monitoring

**Features**:
- Daily dependency updates with automated PRs
- Artifact cleanup (30-day retention)
- Security advisory synchronization
- Performance regression detection
- Code quality metrics tracking
- Automated issue creation for vulnerabilities
- Project metrics updates

### 5. `release.yml` - Release Management
**Purpose**: Automated release process with semantic versioning

**Features**:
- Automated release validation
- Package building and testing
- Release notes generation from commits
- Security scanning before release
- Version management and Git tagging
- Multi-platform publishing (PyPI, Docker)
- Documentation updates
- Stakeholder notifications
- Post-release validation

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create the workflow directory** (if not exists):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   ```

2. **Copy each workflow file** from the `github-workflows-to-add/` directory to `.github/workflows/`

3. **Update repository settings**:
   - Go to Settings → Actions → General
   - Enable "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"
   - Set workflow permissions to "Read and write permissions"

4. **Configure secrets** (if needed):
   - `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` - For deployment notifications
   - Additional secrets for external services

5. **Set up environments** (optional but recommended):
   - Create "staging" and "production" environments
   - Configure protection rules for production deployments

6. **Enable Dependabot** (already configured):
   - The `dependabot.yml` file is already in place
   - Dependabot will automatically create PRs for dependency updates

## Workflow Triggers

- **CI (`ci.yml`)**: Runs on every push and PR to main/develop branches
- **CD (`cd.yml`)**: Runs on releases and manual deployment triggers
- **Security (`security.yml`)**: Runs weekly and on pushes to main
- **Maintenance (`maintenance.yml`)**: Runs daily at 3 AM UTC
- **Release (`release.yml`)**: Runs on release creation and manual triggers

## Expected Benefits

Once these workflows are in place, you'll have:

✅ **Automated Quality Gates**: Every PR automatically tested and validated
✅ **Security Hardening**: Continuous security scanning and vulnerability management
✅ **Automated Deployments**: Push-button deployments with rollback capabilities
✅ **Maintenance Automation**: Self-maintaining repository with automated updates
✅ **Release Management**: Professional release process with semantic versioning

## Monitoring

After setup, monitor workflow runs in the Actions tab. The workflows include:
- Comprehensive logging and error reporting
- Performance benchmarking and regression detection
- Security scan results and SARIF uploads
- Artifact generation and retention management

These workflows represent industry best practices and provide enterprise-grade CI/CD automation for the reflexion-agent-boilerplate project.
