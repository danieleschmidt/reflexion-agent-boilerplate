**Status:** Template  
**Date:** 2025-07-28  
**Deciders:** Development Team  

## Context

This document serves as a template for Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in the Reflexion Agent Boilerplate project. ADRs help us document important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences.

## Decision

We will use the following template for all architecture decision records:

### Template Structure
- **Status**: [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]
- **Date**: Decision date (YYYY-MM-DD)  
- **Deciders**: Who was involved in making this decision
- **Context**: What is the issue that we're trying to solve?
- **Decision**: What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
- **References**: Links to supporting material

## Consequences

### Positive
- Consistent documentation format across all architectural decisions
- Clear rationale for future developers to understand design choices
- Searchable repository of architectural knowledge
- Helps avoid repeating past mistakes

### Negative
- Additional overhead for documenting decisions
- Requires discipline to maintain up-to-date records
