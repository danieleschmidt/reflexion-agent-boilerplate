# ADR-0003: Checkpointed SDLC Implementation Strategy

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-08-02  
**Authors:** Terry (Terragon Labs)  
**Reviewers:** Engineering Team  
**Tags:** sdlc, process, automation, checkpoints

## Context

The reflexion-agent-boilerplate project requires a comprehensive Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) implementation that can handle GitHub App permission limitations while ensuring reliable progress tracking and deployment.

## Decision

We will implement a **Checkpointed SDLC Strategy** that breaks the implementation into discrete, sequential checkpoints that can be independently committed, pushed, and validated.

### Checkpoint Strategy Benefits

1. **Permission Resilience**: Each checkpoint can proceed independently of GitHub App permissions
2. **Progress Tracking**: Clear visibility into implementation progress and completion status
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Incremental changes reduce deployment risk and enable rollback
4. **Quality Assurance**: Each checkpoint can be validated before proceeding to the next

### Implementation Approach

1. **Sequential Execution**: Process checkpoints in priority order (HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW)
2. **Independent Commits**: Each checkpoint results in a separate commit and push
3. **Documentation First**: Document requirements when permissions are insufficient
4. **Validation Gates**: Verify checkpoint completion before advancing

## Architectural Impact

└── monitoring/                 # Observability configuration
```

### Quality Gates
- Code quality: 90%+ test coverage, automated linting
- Security: Vulnerability scanning, dependency audits
- Performance: Automated benchmarking and regression testing
- Documentation: Comprehensive API docs and examples

## Implementation Timeline

### Checkpoint Sequence
1. **Foundation & Documentation** (Priority: HIGH)
2. **Development Environment & Tooling** (Priority: HIGH)  
3. **Testing Infrastructure** (Priority: HIGH)
4. **Build & Containerization** (Priority: MEDIUM)
5. **Monitoring & Observability** (Priority: MEDIUM)
6. **Workflow Documentation & Templates** (Priority: HIGH)
7. **Metrics & Automation** (Priority: MEDIUM)
8. **Integration & Final Configuration** (Priority: LOW)

### Permission Handling
- **GitHub App Limitations**: Document required manual steps
- **Workflow Creation**: Provide templates in docs/workflows/examples/
- **Repository Settings**: Use GitHub API where possible, document manual steps

## Alternative Approaches

### Monolithic Implementation
**Rejected**: Would require extensive permissions and create large, difficult-to-review changes.

### Framework-Specific SDLC
**Rejected**: Our focus is on framework-agnostic reflexion capabilities, not framework-specific tooling.

### External SDLC Tools
**Rejected**: Maintains consistency with existing repository structure and reduces external dependencies.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Incremental Progress**: Clear milestones and deliverables
- **Risk Reduction**: Smaller changesets reduce integration risk
- **Permission Flexibility**: Works within GitHub App constraints
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation at each checkpoint

### Negative
- **Additional Overhead**: More planning and documentation required
- **Sequential Dependencies**: Some parallelization opportunities lost
- **Manual Steps**: Some operations require manual intervention due to permissions

## Compliance

This approach ensures compliance with:
- **Security Standards**: Each checkpoint includes security validation
- **Open Source Best Practices**: Comprehensive documentation and contribution guidelines
- **Enterprise Requirements**: Monitoring, observability, and operational procedures
- **AI Governance**: Responsible AI development and deployment practices

## Monitoring

Success will be measured by:
- **Checkpoint Completion Rate**: Target 100% completion within timeline
- **Code Quality Metrics**: Maintain 90%+ test coverage
- **Security Compliance**: Zero high-severity vulnerabilities
- **Documentation Coverage**: 95%+ API documentation coverage

## Review Schedule

This ADR will be reviewed:
- **Monthly**: Progress assessment and timeline adjustment
- **Quarterly**: Strategic alignment and approach validation
- **Post-Implementation**: Lessons learned and process improvement
