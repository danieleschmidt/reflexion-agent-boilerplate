# ADR-0002: Reflexion Engine Core Design

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-07-28  
**Deciders:** Core Development Team  

## Context

The reflexion engine is the heart of our system, implementing the core reflexion loop that enables agents to learn from failures and improve their performance over time. We need to decide on the fundamental architecture that will support multiple framework adapters while maintaining consistency and extensibility.

## Decision

We will implement a plugin-based reflexion engine with the following core components:

### Core Architecture
1. **ReflexionEngine**: Central orchestrator managing the reflexion loop
2. **Framework Adapters**: Plugin interfaces for different agent frameworks  
3. **Memory Systems**: Pluggable storage for episodes and reflections
4. **Evaluator Framework**: Extensible evaluation and success criteria system
5. **Reflection Templates**: Domain-specific reflection prompts and strategies

### Key Design Principles
- **Framework Agnostic**: Support multiple agent frameworks through adapters
- **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for memory, evaluation, and reflection strategies
- **Consistent**: Unified API across all framework implementations
- **Observable**: Rich metrics and telemetry for monitoring and improvement

### Implementation Strategy
- Abstract base classes define interfaces for all pluggable components
- Factory pattern for component instantiation and configuration
- Async/await throughout for non-blocking operations
- Type hints and validation for robust API contracts

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add support for new frameworks
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Testability**: Each component can be tested independently
- **Performance**: Async design enables concurrent operations
- **Consistency**: Unified behavior across different framework adapters

### Negative
- **Complexity**: More abstract architecture requires deeper understanding
- **Initial Development**: More upfront design and implementation work
- **Performance Overhead**: Plugin system adds some runtime overhead
- **Testing Complexity**: More integration points to test

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Framework-specific edge cases not handled by adapters
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing suite with real framework scenarios
- **Risk**: Performance bottlenecks in the plugin system
  - **Mitigation**: Benchmarking and profiling during development
