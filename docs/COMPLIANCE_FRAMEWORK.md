- **Security**: Implement appropriate technical measures
- **Accountability**: Demonstrate compliance

**Implementation:**
```python
# Example: GDPR-compliant data retention
class GDPRCompliantMemoryStore:
    def __init__(self, retention_days=365):
        self.retention_days = retention_days
    
    def cleanup_expired_data(self):
        cutoff_date = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=self.retention_days)
        # Remove personal data older than retention period
        self.db.delete_where(created_at < cutoff_date)
```

### HIPAA Compliance (Healthcare Deployments)

# Example audit log structure
audit_log:
  timestamp: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  user_id: "user123"
  action: "data_access"
  resource: "memory_episode_456"
  source_ip: "192.168.1.100"
  user_agent: "ReflexionClient/1.0"
  outcome: "success"
  details:
    query_type: "similarity_search" 
    records_returned: 5
    retention_check: "passed"
```

## Data Governance

### Data Classification

**Sensitivity Levels:**
- **Public**: Can be freely shared
- **Internal**: For internal use only

- **Restricted**: Highest level of protection

**Reflexion Data Types:**

- Agent outputs: Internal/Confidential
- Reflection content: Confidential
- Memory episodes: Confidential/Restricted
- User interactions: Restricted (if containing PII)

### Data Lifecycle Management

**Stages:**
1. **Creation**: Data classification and tagging
2. **Processing**: Secure processing with appropriate controls
3. **Storage**: Encrypted storage with access controls
4. **Sharing**: Controlled sharing with approved parties
5. **Archival**: Long-term storage with reduced access
6. **Destruction**: Secure deletion at end of lifecycle

### Data Subject Rights (GDPR)

**Rights Implementation:**
- **Right to be Informed**: Privacy notices provided
- **Right of Access**: Data export functionality
