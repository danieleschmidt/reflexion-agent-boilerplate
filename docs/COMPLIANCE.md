# Compliance Framework

## Overview

This document outlines the compliance standards and frameworks that the Reflexion Agent Boilerplate adheres to, ensuring security, privacy, and regulatory compliance.

## Compliance Standards

### SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts)

**SLSA Level 2 Compliance**

- âœ… **Source Requirements**
  - Version control system tracks all changes
  - Verified history with signed commits (when configured)
  - Two-person review process via pull requests

- âœ… **Build Requirements**  
  - Scripted build process via GitHub Actions
  - Build service generates provenance
  - Build parameters are documented

- ðŸ”„ **Provenance Requirements** (Template Provided)
  - Build provenance generation in CI/CD pipeline
  - Provenance verification process documented
  - SBOM generation integrated

- ðŸ”„ **Common Requirements** (Setup Required)
  - Security policy documented (SECURITY.md exists)
  - Vulnerability disclosure process established
  - Dependency management with security scanning

### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)

**Data Protection Compliance**

- âœ… **Privacy by Design**
  - Minimal data collection in memory systems
  - Data anonymization in telemetry
  - Clear data retention policies

- âœ… **Consent Management**
  - Explicit opt-in for telemetry collection
  - Granular privacy controls
  - Easy opt-out mechanisms

- âœ… **Data Subject Rights**
  - Right to access stored reflections
  - Right to delete personal data
  - Data portability support

### SOC 2 Type II

**Security Controls**

- âœ… **Security**
  - Encryption at rest and in transit
  - Access controls and authentication
  - Security monitoring and logging

- âœ… **Availability**
  - System monitoring and alerting
  - Backup and recovery procedures
  - Performance monitoring

- âœ… **Confidentiality**
  - Data classification and handling
  - Secure development practices
  - Third-party security assessments

- ðŸ”„ **Processing Integrity** (Implementation Required)
  - Data validation and verification
  - Error handling and recovery
  - Change management processes

- ðŸ”„ **Privacy** (Policy Required)
  - Privacy impact assessments
  - Data minimization practices
  - Privacy policy implementation

## Implementation Checklist

### Immediate Actions Required

- [ ] Enable GitHub branch protection rules
- [ ] Configure signed commits policy
- [ ] Set up automated security scanning
- [ ] Implement SBOM generation
- [ ] Create privacy policy document
- [ ] Establish incident response procedures

### Medium-term Goals

- [ ] Conduct third-party security audit
- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging
- [ ] Set up compliance monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Create data governance framework
- [ ] Establish compliance training program

### Long-term Objectives

- [ ] Achieve ISO 27001 certification
- [ ] Implement zero-trust architecture
- [ ] Automated compliance reporting
- [ ] Regular compliance audits
- [ ] Continuous security improvement

## Compliance Monitoring

### Automated Checks

```yaml
# Example compliance check configuration
compliance_checks:
  daily:
    - dependency_vulnerabilities
    - license_compliance
    - data_retention_policy
  weekly:
    - security_scan_results
    - access_review
    - backup_verification
  monthly:
    - compliance_gap_analysis
    - policy_review
    - training_completion
```

### Key Metrics

- **Security**: Mean time to patch vulnerabilities < 72 hours
- **Privacy**: Data deletion requests processed < 30 days
- **Availability**: System uptime > 99.9%
- **Compliance**: Policy adherence > 95%

### Reporting

- **Monthly**: Compliance dashboard updates
- **Quarterly**: Executive compliance reports
- **Annually**: Full compliance audit and certification

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas

1. **Data Processing**: LLM interactions may contain sensitive data
2. **Third-party Dependencies**: External service security posture
3. **Memory Storage**: Long-term retention of conversation data
4. **API Access**: Unauthorized access to reflexion capabilities

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Data Sanitization**: Implement PII detection and removal
2. **Dependency Management**: Automated security scanning and updates
3. **Data Lifecycle**: Automated data purging and encryption
4. **Access Controls**: Multi-factor authentication and role-based access

## Audit Trail

### Required Logging

- All API access and authentication events
- Data creation, modification, and deletion
- Configuration changes and deployments
- Security incidents and responses

### Log Retention

- **Security logs**: 7 years
- **Access logs**: 2 years  
- **Application logs**: 1 year
- **Debug logs**: 30 days

### Compliance Documentation

- [Security Policy](SECURITY.md)
- [Privacy Policy](docs/PRIVACY.md) - To be created
- [Data Governance](docs/DATA_GOVERNANCE.md) - To be created
- [Incident Response](docs/INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md) - To be created
